## What is runinsights
What started off as a challenge to run a marathon (26.2 miles) has become a new hobbie and lifestyle. The first thing that my friends and I did was download strava (popular running/activity tracking app). Strava has helped us keep each other motivated and accountable for our marathon and has a lot of great features. However, unless you subscribe to pay monthly on strava, all you can see is base level analytics on recorded runs. As someone who wants to improve and loves looking at my recorded run data, I wanted to find a way to get a bigger deep dive into my runs. This is where runinsights came to my mind. What if I can create something for myself to see a lot more details of my recorded runs.
